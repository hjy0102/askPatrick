# askPatrick
Authors: Tim Straubinger, Hyojin (Ginnie) Yi

===What is the problem?===

We would like to create a natural language interface to a virtual friend named Patrick. Patrick can be asked basic questions about his feelings, his opinions (which we hope to give a humorous bias), and can also pose questions to given statements, asking well-composed what, why or how questions that are applicable to the input sentence. In the event that the input doesn't make sense, Patrick will respond with a confused retort, and if a question is posed that Patrick isn't well-informed enough to answer meaningfully, Patrick will respond with a humble acknowledgement that he cannot say, or may respond with a clever dodging of the original question.


===What is the something extra?===

Our project will involve a very detailed language interpreting system that will build upon Dr. Poole's provided simple noun-phrase-verb-phrase tree structure. We will need to be able to classify given input sequences into statements and questions, possibly using clues from punctuation such as commas and question marks, so that Patrick can respond selectively to these different inputs. We will also need to be able to isolate failed grammatical interpretation from a lack knowledge in the database with which to respond, so that Patrick can answer nonsensical input with mock confusion, as opposed to ''false.'' We will also need to build a rich database of Patrick's personal information, detailing his likes and dislikes, the relationships between things that he is aware of, and a richer mapping from grammatical structure to relations between entities mentioned in the input sentence and their implications unto the queries made to this database.

===What did we learn from doing this?===
